 abstract = {We investigate the possibility of leveraging side information for improving quality control over crowd-sourced data. We extend the GLAD model, which governs the probability of correct labeling through a logistic function in which worker expertise counteracts item difficulty, by systematically encod- ing different types of side information, including worker in- formation drawn from demographics and personality traits, item information drawn from item genres and content, and contextual information drawn from worker responses and la- beling sessions. Modeling side information allows for better estimation of worker expertise and item difficulty in sparse data situations and accounts for worker biases, leading to bet- ter prediction of posterior true label probabilities. We demon- strate the efficacy of the proposed framework with overall improvements in both the true label prediction and the un- seen worker response prediction based on different combina- tions of the various types of side information across three new crowd-sourcing datasets. In addition, we show the framework exhibits potential of identifying salient side information fea- tures for predicting the correctness of responses without the need of knowing any true label information.},
