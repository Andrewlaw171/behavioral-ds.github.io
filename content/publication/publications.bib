  abstract={The Hawkes process (HP) has been widely applied to modeling self-exciting events including neuron spikes, earthquakes and tweets. To avoid designing parametric triggering kernel and to be able to quantify the prediction confidence, the non-parametric Bayesian HP has been proposed. However, the inference of such models suffers from unscalability or slow convergence. In this paper, we aim to solve both problems. Specifically, first, we propose a new non-parametric Bayesian HP in which the triggering kernel is modeled as a squared sparse Gaussian process. Then, we propose a novel variational inference schema for model optimization. We employ the branching structure of the HP so that maximization of evidence lower bound (ELBO) is tractable by the expectation-maximization algorithm. We propose a tighter ELBO which improves the fitting performance. Further, we accelerate the novel variational inference schema to linear time complexity by leveraging the stationarity of the triggering kernel. Different from prior acceleration methods, ours enjoys higher efficiency. Finally, we exploit synthetic data and two large social media datasets to evaluate our method. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art non-parametric frequentist and Bayesian methods. We validate the efficiency of our accelerated variational inference schema and practical utility of our tighter ELBO for model selection. We observe that the tighter ELBO exceeds the common one in model selection.},

  year={2020},
  abstract = {Epidemic models and self-exciting processes are two types of models used to describe diffusion phenomena online and offline. These models were originally developed in different scientific communities, and their commonalities are under-explored. This work establishes, for the first time, a general connection between the two model classes via three new mathematical components. The first is a generalized version of stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with arbitrary recovery time distributions; the second is the relationship between the (latent and arbitrary) recovery time distribution, recovery hazard function, and the infection kernel of self-exciting processes; the third includes methods for simulating, fitting, evaluating and predicting the generalized process. On three large Twitter diffusion datasets, we conduct goodness-of-fit tests and holdout log-likelihood evaluation of self-exciting processes with three infection kernels --- exponential, power-law and Tsallis Q-exponential. We show that the modeling performance of the infection kernels varies with respect to the temporal structures of diffusions, and also with respect to user behavior, such as the likelihood of being bots. We further improve the prediction of popularity by combining two models that are identified as complementary by the goodness-of-fit tests.},

    year = {2019},
    abstract = {Online videos have shown tremendous increase in Internet traffic. Most video hosting sites implement recommender systems, which connect the videos into a directed network and conceptually act as a source of pathways for users to navigate. At present, little is known about how human attention is allocated over such large-scale networks, and about the impacts of the recommender systems. In this paper, we first construct the Vevo network -- a YouTube video network with 60,740 music videos interconnected by the recommendation links, and we collect their associated viewing dynamics. This results in a total of 310 million views every day over a period of 9 weeks. Next, we present large-scale measurements that connect the structure of the recommendation network and the video attention dynamics. We use the bow-tie structure to characterize the Vevo network and we find that its core component (23.1% of the videos), which occupies most of the attention (82.6% of the views), is made out of videos that are mainly recommended among themselves. This is indicative of the links between video recommendation and the inequality of attention allocation. Finally, we address the task of estimating the attention flow in the video recommendation network. We propose a model that accounts for the network effects for predicting video popularity, and we show it consistently outperforms the baselines. This model also identifies a group of artists gaining attention because of the recommendation network. Altogether, our observations and our models provide a new set of tools to better understand the impacts of recommender systems on collective social attention.},

    abstract={In the digital era, individuals are increasingly profiled and grouped based on the traces that they leave behind in online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. In this paper, we develop and evaluate a novel text analysis approach for studying user identity and social roles by redefining identity as a sequence of timestamped items (e.g., tweet texts). We operationalise this idea by developing a novel text distance metric, the time-sensitive semantic edit distance (t-SED), which accounts for the temporal context across multiple traces. To evaluate this method, we undertake a case study of Russian online-troll activity within US political discourse. The novel metric allows us to classify the social roles of trolls based on their traces, in this case tweets, into one of the predefined categories left-leaning, right-leaning, and news feed. We show the effectiveness of the t-SED metric to measure the similarities between tweets while accounting for the temporal context, and we use novel data visualisation techniques and qualitative analysis to uncover new empirical insights into Russian troll activity that have not been identified in the previous work. In addition, we highlight a connection with the field of actor--network theory and the related hypotheses of Gabriel Tarde, and we discuss how social sequence analysis using t-SED may provide new avenues for tackling a longstanding problem in social theory: how to analyse society without separating reality into micro vs. macro-levels.},

Recent work has revealed the equivalence between the two for information diffusion modeling. This allows tools created for one class of models to be applied to another. However, epidemic models and Hawkes point processes can be connected in more ways. This thesis aims to develop a rich set of mathematical equivalences and extensions, and use them to ask and answer questions in social media and beyond. Specifically, we show our plan of generalizing the equivalence of the two model classes by extending it to Hawkes point process models with arbitrary memory kernels. We then outline a rich set of quantities describing diffusion, including diffusion size and extinction probability, introduced in the fields where the models are originally designed. Lastly, we discuss some novel applications of these quantities in a range of problems such as popularity prediction and popularity intervention.},

    abstract = {Serious concerns have been raised about the role of `socialbots' in manipulating public opinion and influencing the outcome of elections by retweeting partisan content to increase its reach. Here we analyze the role and influence of socialbots on Twitter by determining how they contribute to retweet diffusions. We collect a large dataset of tweets during the 1st U.S. presidential debate in 2016 and we analyze its 1.5 million users from three perspectives: user influence, political behavior (partisanship and engagement) and botness. First, we define a measure of user influence based on the user's active contributions to information diffusions, i.e. their tweets and retweets. Given that Twitter does not expose the retweet structure -- it associates all retweets with the original tweet -- we model the latent diffusion structure using only tweet time and user features, and we implement a scalable novel approach to estimate influence over all possible unfoldings. Next, we use partisan hashtag analysis to quantify user political polarization and engagement. Finally, we use the BotOrNot API to measure user botness (the likelihood of being a bot). We build a two-dimensional "polarization map" that allows for a nuanced analysis of the interplay between botness, partisanship and influence. We find that not only are socialbots more active on Twitter -- starting more retweet cascades and retweeting more -- but they are 2.5 times more influential than humans, and more politically engaged. Moreover, pro-Republican bots are both more influential and more politically engaged than their pro-Democrat counterparts. However we caution against blanket statements that software designed to appear human dominates politics-related activity on Twitter. Firstly, it is known that accounts controlled by teams of humans (e.g. organizational accounts) are often identified as bots. Secondly, we find that many highly influential Twitter users are in fact pro-Democrat and that most pro-Republican users are mid-influential and likely to be human (low botness).},

Most current research focus on modeling the number of views, but we argue that video engagement, or time spent watching is a more appropriate measure for resource allocation problems in attention, networking, and promotion activities. In this paper, we present a first large-scale measurement of video-level aggregate engagement from publicly available data streams, on a collection of 5.3 million YouTube videos published over two months in 2016. We study a set of metrics including time and the average percentage of a video watched. We define a new metric, relative engagement, that is calibrated against video properties and strongly correlate with recognized notions of quality. Moreover, we find that engagement measures of a video are stable over time, thus separating the concerns for modeling engagement and those for popularity -- the latter is known to be unstable over time and driven by external promotions. We also find engagement metrics predictable from a cold-start setup, having most of its variance explained by video context, topics and channel information -- R2=0.77. Our observations imply several prospective uses of engagement metrics -- choosing engaging topics for video production, or promoting engaging videos in recommender systems.},

    year = {2018},
    abstract = {Understanding and predicting the popularity of online items is an important open problem in social media analysis. Considerable progress has been made recently in data-driven predictions, and in linking popularity to external promotions. However, the existing methods typically focus on a single source of external influence, whereas for many types of online content such as YouTube videos or news articles, attention is driven by multiple heterogeneous sources simultaneously - e.g. microblogs or traditional media coverage. Here, we propose RNN-MAS, a recurrent neural network for modeling asynchronous streams. It is a sequence generator that connects multiple streams of different granularity via joint inference. We show RNN-MAS not only to outperform the current state-of-the-art Youtube popularity prediction system by 17%, but also to capture complex dynamics, such as seasonal trends of unseen influence. We define two new metrics: promotion score quantifies the gain in popularity from one unit of promotion for a Youtube video; the loudness level captures the effects of a particular user tweeting about the video. We use the loudness level to compare the effects of a video being promoted by a single highly-followed user (in the top 1% most followed users) against being promoted by a group of mid-followed users. We find that results depend on the type of content being promoted: superusers are more successful in promoting Howto and Gaming videos, whereas the cohort of regular users are more influential for Activism videos. This work provides more accurate and explainable popularity predictions, as well as computational tools for content producers and marketers to allocate resources for promotion campaigns.},

The former originate from epidemiology, and consider information as a viral contagion which spreads into a population of online users. The latter have roots in geophysics and finance, view individual actions as discrete events in continuous time, and modulate the rate of events according to the self-exciting nature of event sequences. Here, we establish a novel connection between these two frameworks. Namely, the rate of events in an extended Hawkes model is identical to the rate of new infections in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model after marginalizing out recovery events -- which are unobserved in a Hawkes process. This result paves the way to apply tools developed for SIR to Hawkes, and vice versa. It also leads to HawkesN, a generalization of the Hawkes model which accounts for a finite population size. Finally, we derive the distribution of cascade sizes for HawkesN, inspired by methods in stochastic SIR. Such distributions provide nuanced explanations to the general unpredictability of popularity: the distribution for diffusion cascade sizes tends to have two modes, one corresponding to large cascade sizes and another one around zero.},

This work supplies the missing link between exogenous inputs from public social media platforms, such as Twitter, and endogenous responses within the content platform, such as YouTube. We develop a novel mathematical model, the Hawkes intensity process, which can explain the complex popularity history of each video according to its type of content, network of diffusion, and sensitivity to promotion. Our model supplies a prototypical description of videos, called an endo-exo map. This map explains popularity as the result of an extrinsic factor -- the amount of promotions from the outside world that the video receives, acting upon two intrinsic factors -- sensitivity to promotion, and inherent virality. We use this model to forecast future popularity given promotions on a large 5-months feed of the most-tweeted videos, and found it to lower the average error by 28.6% from approaches based on popularity history. Finally, we can identify videos that have a high potential to become viral, as well as those for which promotions will have hardly any effect.},

This paper presents an in-depth study of popularity dynamics under external promotions, especially in predicting popularity jumps of online videos, and determining effective and efficient schedules to promote online content. The recently-proposed Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP) models popularity as a non-linear interplay between exogenous stimuli and the endogenous reaction. We propose two novel metrics based on HIP: to describe popularity gain per unit of promotion, and to quantify the time it takes for such effects to unfold. We make increasingly accurate forecasts of future popularity by including information about the intrinsic properties of the video, promotions it receives, and the non-linear effects of popularity ranking. We illustrate by simulation the interplay between the unfolding of popularity over time, and the time-sensitive value of resources. Lastly, our model lends a novel explanation of the commonly adopted periodic and constant promotion strategy in advertising, as increasing the perceived viral potential. This study provides quantitative guidelines about setting promotion schedules considering content virality, timing, and economics.},

We model each social cascade with a marked Hawkes self-exciting point process, and estimate the content virality, memory decay, and user influence. We then learn a predictive layer for popularity prediction using a collection of cascade history. To our surprise, Hawkes process with a predictive overlay outperform recent feature-driven and generative approaches on existing tweet data [44] and a new public benchmark on news tweets. We also found that a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks, and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions.

As an online system evolves over time, new digital traces of individual behavior may uncover previously hidden statistical links between an individual’s past actions and her private traits. Furthermore, this de-anonymization trend may not be observable when analyzing short or medium time-span snapshots of data. To quantify this effect, we analyze the evolution of individual privacy loss by studying the 13-year long edit history of Wikipedia, including more than 117,523 different users performing 188,805,088 edits. We trace each Wikipedia’s contributor using apparently harmless features, such as the number of edits performed on predefined broad categories in a given time period (e.g. Mathematics, Culture or Nature). We show that even at this unspecific level of identification, it is possible to use off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms to uncover usually undisclosed private traits, such as gender, religion or education. We provide empirical evidence that the prediction accuracy for almost all private traits consistently improves over time. Moreover, we observe that the system also shows improved prediction for users who participated in the system during “safe” periods — periods where a given individual’s private traits could not be — showing that de-anonymization threats are hard to foresee as online systems evolve. Insights from this work should help users, system designers, and policy makers understand and debate the design and long-term effects of online content creation systems.},
