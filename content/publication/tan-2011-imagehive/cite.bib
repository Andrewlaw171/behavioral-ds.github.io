 abstract = {ImageHive communicates information about an image collection by generating a summary image that preserves the relationships between images and avoids occluding their salient parts. It uses a constrained graph-layout algorithm first, to preserve image similarities and keep important parts visible, and then a constrained Voronoi tessellation algorithm to locally refine the layout and tile the image plane.},
