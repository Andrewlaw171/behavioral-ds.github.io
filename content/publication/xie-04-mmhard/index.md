abstract: "Using the ACM Multimedia 2012 panel on metadata as a jumping-off point, the authors investigate whether content can continue to play a dominant role in multimedia research in the age of social, local, and mobile media. In this article, they propose that the community now must face the challenge of characterizing the level of difficulty of multimedia problems to establish a better understanding of where content analysis needs further improvement. They also suggest a classification method that defines problem complexity in the context of human-assisted computation."
