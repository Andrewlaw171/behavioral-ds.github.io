abstract: "I develop techniques that can be used to incorporate stylistic objectives into existing image captioning systems. Style is generally a very tricky concept to define, thus I concentrate on two specific components of style. First I develop a technique for predicting how people will name visual objects. I demonstrate that this technique could be used to generate captions with human like naming conventions. Full details are available in a recent publication. Second I outline a system for generating sentences which express a strong positive or negative sentiment. Finally I present two possible future directions which are aimed at modelling style more generally. These are learning to imitate an individuals captioning style and generating a diverse set of captions for a single image."
