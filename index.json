Currently, it assumes univariate processes without background event rates. Prior knowledge about the models is assumed in the following tutorial and please refer to [1] and [2] for details about the models.\nlibrary(evently)  Installation and dependencies Several dependencies (poweRlaw, AMPL, Ipopt) are required for running this package. These dependencies will be installed automatically by R or by following instructions upon package load.\nInstall the package by executing\nif (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools') devtools::install_github('behavioral-ds/evently')  Simulating cascades Let’s first simulate 100 event cascades of the Hawkes process with an exponential kernel function (please refer to the Available models for models and their abbreviations in the package) with a given parameter set, . For each simulation, we only simulate until 5 seconds. The resulted cascades are placed in a single list where each cascade is a data.frame.\nset.seed(4) sim_no \u0026lt;- 100 data \u0026lt;- generate_hawkes_event_series(par = c(K = 0.9, theta = 1), model_type = 'EXP', Tmax = 5, sim_no = sim_no) # alternatively, `generate_hawkes_event_series` also accepts a model class object # e.g. # model \u0026lt;- new_hawkes_model(par = c(K = 0.9, theta = 1), model_type = 'EXP') # generate_hawkes_event_series(model = model, Tmax = 5, sim_no = sim_no) head(data[[1]])  ## magnitude time ## 1 1 0.0000000 ## 2 1 0.5941959 ## 3 1 1.4712411 ## 4 1 1.6105430 ## 5 1 1.7855535 ## 6 1 1.8883869  A simulated process is represented by a data.frame where each row is an event. time indicates the event happening time, while magnitude is the event mark information which is always 1 if model_type is an unmarked model. In the context of retweet diffusion cascades, the first row is the original tweet and all following events are its retweets. time records the relative time (in second) of each retweet to the original tweet and magnitude is the follows’ count of the user who retweeted.\nFitting a model on data We can then fit on the cascades simulated in the previous section. After providing the data and model_type, the fitting procedure will spawn 10 AMPL optimization procedures with different parameter inistializations due to the non-convexity of some likelihood functions. Among the 10 fitted model, the one giving the best likelihood value will be returned. To make the fitting procedure faster, we can specify the number of cores to be used for fitting them in parallel.\nfitted_model \u0026lt;- fit_series(data, model_type = 'EXP', observation_time = 5, cores = 10) fitted_model  ## Model: EXP ## No. of cascades: 100 ## init_par ## K 7.92e+00; theta 1.32e+00 ## par ## K 8.51e-01; theta 1.06e+00 ## Neg Log Likelihood: 285.488 ## lower_bound ## K 1.00e-100; theta 1.00e-100 ## upper_bound ## K 1.00e+04; theta 3.00e+02 ## convergence: 0  Available models There are 8 models available so far in this package:\n   Model Abbreviation (model_type) Intensity Function Parameters     Hawkes process with an exponential kernel function EXP  K,theta   Hawkes process with a power-law kernel function PL  K,c,theta   HawkesN process with an exponential kernel function EXPN  K,theta,N   HawkesN process with a power-law kernel function PLN  K,c,theta,N   Marked Hawkes process with an exponential kernel function mEXP  K,beta,theta   Marked Hawkes process with a power-law kernel function mPL  K,beta,c,theta   Marked HawkesN process with an exponential kernel function mEXPN  K,beta,theta,N   Marked HawkesN process with a power-law kernel function mPLN  K,beta,c,theta,N    Acknowledgement The development of this package is supported by the Green Policy grant from the National Security College, Crawford School, ANU.\nLicense Both dataset and code are distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) license.
