These models were originally developed in different scientific communities, and their commonalities are under-explored. This work establishes, for the first time, a general connection between the two model classes via three new mathematical components. The first is a generalized version of stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with arbitrary recovery time distributions; the second is the relationship between the (latent and arbitrary) recovery time distribution, recovery hazard function, and the infection kernel of self-exciting processes; the third includes methods for simulating, fitting, evaluating and predicting the generalized process. On three large Twitter diffusion datasets, we conduct goodness-of-fit tests and holdout log-likelihood evaluation of self-exciting processes with three infection kernels --- exponential, power-law and Tsallis Q-exponential. We show that the modeling performance of the infection kernels varies with respect to the temporal structures of diffusions, and also with respect to user behavior, such as the likelihood of being bots. We further improve the prediction of popularity by combining two models that are identified as complementary by the goodness-of-fit tests.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Information Cascades with Self-exciting Processes via Generalized Epidemic Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rui Zhang","Christian Walder","Marian-Andrei Rizoiu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"482b8ba75ccf5ce0f190c363dc09f80b","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/zhang-aaai-2020/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.469442Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-aaai-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The Hawkes process (HP) has been widely applied to modeling self-exciting events including neuron spikes, earthquakes and tweets. To avoid designing parametric triggering kernel and to be able to quantify the prediction confidence, the non-parametric Bayesian HP has been proposed. However, the inference of such models suffers from unscalability or slow convergence. In this paper, we aim to solve both problems. Specifically, first, we propose a new non-parametric Bayesian HP in which the triggering kernel is modeled as a squared sparse Gaussian process. Then, we propose a novel variational inference schema for model optimization. We employ the branching structure of the HP so that maximization of evidence lower bound (ELBO) is tractable by the expectation-maximization algorithm. We propose a tighter ELBO which improves the fitting performance. Further, we accelerate the novel variational inference schema to linear time complexity by leveraging the stationarity of the triggering kernel. Different from prior acceleration methods, ours enjoys higher efficiency. Finally, we exploit synthetic data and two large social media datasets to evaluate our method. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art non-parametric frequentist and Bayesian methods. We validate the efficiency of our accelerated variational inference schema and practical utility of our tighter ELBO for model selection. We observe that the tighter ELBO exceeds the common one in model selection.","tags":null,"title":"Variational Inference for Sparse Gaussian Process Modulated Hawkes Process","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Quyu Kong"],"categories":["posts"],"content":"This is an example project description\n","date":1573516800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573516800,"objectID":"568f0bb5e76ecb25f706eec0b7de3470","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/project/project1/","publishdate":"2019-11-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/project1/","section":"project","summary":"This is an example project description","tags":["R"],"title":"Epidemic Hawkes: an example project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Quyu Kong"],"categories":["posts"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

In this paper, we develop and evaluate a novel text analysis approach for studying user identity and social roles by redefining identity as a sequence of timestamped items (e.g., tweet texts). We operationalise this idea by developing a novel text distance metric, the time-sensitive semantic edit distance (t-SED), which accounts for the temporal context across multiple traces. To evaluate this method, we undertake a case study of Russian online-troll activity within US political discourse. The novel metric allows us to classify the social roles of trolls based on their traces, in this case tweets, into one of the predefined categories left-leaning, right-leaning, and news feed. We show the effectiveness of the t-SED metric to measure the similarities between tweets while accounting for the temporal context, and we use novel data visualisation techniques and qualitative analysis to uncover new empirical insights into Russian troll activity that have not been identified in the previous work. In addition, we highlight a connection with the field of actor--network theory and the related hypotheses of Gabriel Tarde, and we discuss how social sequence analysis using t-SED may provide new avenues for tackling a longstanding problem in social theory: how to analyse society without separating reality into micro vs. macro-levels.","tags":null,"title":"Analysing user identity via time-sensitive semantic edit distance (t-SED): a case study of Russian trolls on Twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emery Berger","Stephen M.

We observe that gradient-based optimisation outperforms discrete and baseline approaches in 15 out of 24 different automatic evaluation settings. In crowd-sourced evaluations, summaries from gradient optimisation elicit 7% more accurate classification from human workers than discrete optimisation. Our result contrasts with recent literature on submodular data subset selection that favours discrete optimisation.

Most video hosting sites implement recommender systems, which connect the videos into a directed network and conceptually act as a source of pathways for users to navigate. At present, little is known about how human attention is allocated over such large-scale networks, and about the impacts of the recommender systems. In this paper, we first construct the Vevo network -- a YouTube video network with 60,740 music videos interconnected by the recommendation links, and we collect their associated viewing dynamics. This results in a total of 310 million views every day over a period of 9 weeks. Next, we present large-scale measurements that connect the structure of the recommendation network and the video attention dynamics. We use the bow-tie structure to characterize the Vevo network and we find that its core component (23.1% of the videos), which occupies most of the attention (82.6% of the views), is made out of videos that are mainly recommended among themselves. This is indicative of the links between video recommendation and the inequality of attention allocation. Finally, we address the task of estimating the attention flow in the video recommendation network. We propose a model that accounts for the network effects for predicting video popularity, and we show it consistently outperforms the baselines. This model also identifies a group of artists gaining attention because of the recommendation network. Altogether, our observations and our models provide a new set of tools to better understand the impacts of recommender systems on collective social attention.","tags":null,"title":"Estimating Attention Flow in Online Video Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brandon Greenwell","Bradley Boehmke","Jay Cunningham","GBM Developers"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"42bbc1c32c684b2d22138c8531a0606f","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/gbm/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.873324Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gbm/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"gbm: Generalized Boosted Regression Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siqi Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d014fa76e8d3dd1fbc009629653d53ac","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/wu-2019-attention/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.477705Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2019-attention/","section":"publication","summary":"The share of videos on Internet traffic has been growing, e.g., people are now spending a billion hours watching YouTube videos every day. Therefore, understanding how videos capture attention on a global scale is also of growing importance for both research and practice.

In this paper, we take a data-driven approach to studying how human attention is allocated in online videos with respect to both active and passive behaviors. We first investigate the active interaction behaviors by proposing a novel metric to represent the aggregate user engagement on YouTube videos. We show this metric is correlated with video quality, stable over lifetime, and predictable before video's upload.

Thus, understanding and predicting the popularity of online information is an important problem in social media analysis. Considerable progress has been made recently in data-driven predictions, and in linking popularity to various external factors. Most of the work on popularity prediction and understanding is either based on learning a variety of features from full network data or using generative processes to model the event time data. However, there exists no prior work that connects or compares models across different paradigms. Accordingly, this thesis focuses on developing and connecting models to predict and understand popularity across different paradigms and settings. To this aim, we first bridge gaps between feature-driven and generative models with the help of a hybrid model and a new performance benchmark. We model each social diffusion with a marked Hawkes self-exciting point process, and we estimate from data the content virality, memory decay, and user influence. Next, we learn a predictive layer for popularity prediction using a collection of cascade histories. We show the Hawkes process with a predictive overlay outperforms recent feature-driven and generative approaches on both existing tweets data and our new dataset. We also show that a feature-driven method based on a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions. A common benchmark dataset for popularity prediction helps us to utilize both feature-driven, and generative paradigms to better predict and understand online popularity. As the first proposed work that links models across feature-driven and generative models, our work has influenced subsequent works on online popularity since its publication in 2016. Secondly, we identify that the existing methods for popularity modeling and prediction typically focus on a single source of external influence. However, for many types of online content such as YouTube videos or news articles, attention is driven by multiple heterogeneous sources simultaneously - e.g., microblogs and traditional media coverage. Correspondingly, we propose RNN-MAS, a recurrent neural network for modeling asynchronous streams. It is a sequence generator that connects multiple streams of different granularity via joint inference. We show that RNN-MAS not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art YouTube popularity prediction system, but it also captures complex dynamics, such as the seasonal trends of unseen influence. Further, to increase the explainability and interpretability of our model, we propose two new metrics: the emphpromotionresponse quantifies the gain in popularity from one unit of promotion for a YouTube video; the emphloudness level captures the effects of a particular user tweeting about the video. We use the loudness level to compare the effects of a video being promoted by a single highly-followed user (in the top $1%$ most followed users) against the same video being promoted by a group of mid-followed users. We show that results depend on the type of content being promoted: superusers are more successful in promoting Howto and Gaming videos, whereas the cohort of regular users is more influential for Activism videos. Additionally, we apply the RNN-MAS model to the problem of predicting the popularity of an item before being published. We train a single model for a group of videos to learn possible evolution dynamics of a given video from the historical data of the videos in the same group. A novel simulation strategy based on the proposed metrics enables us to simulate a representative promotion for the video, and predict the achieved popularity before it is published. Experiments on our large scale YouTube dataset show that our proposed method outperforms non-trivial baselines. By and large, this thesis proposes models for popularity modeling and prediction that are the first of their kind, and it links models across various paradigms and data availability. This work provides accurate and explainable popularity predictions, as well as computational tools for content producers and marketers to allocate resources for promotion campaigns. In addition to these contributions, this work may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of popularity prediction and understanding models across different classes or types.","tags":null,"title":"Linking Models for Collective Attention in Social Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dawei Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0e2db1d6a6d1b379ab436860a14ad038","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/chen-2019-thesis/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.471889Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2019-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Recommender systems have been widely adopted in industry to help people find the most appropriate items to purchase or consume from the increasingly large collection of available resources (e.g., books, songs and movies).

Such structured objects pose critical challenges to recommender systems due to the intractability of ranking all possible candidates. This thesis study the problem of recommending structured objects, in particular, the recommendation of path (a sequence of unique elements) and set (a collection of distinct elements). We study the problem of recommending travel trajectories in a city, which is a typical instance of path recommendation. We propose methods that combine learning to rank and route planning techniques for efficient trajectory recommendation. Another contribution of this thesis is to develop the structured recommendation approach for path recommendation by substantially modifying the loss function, the learning and inference procedures of structured support vector machines. A novel application of path decoding techniques helps us achieve efficient learning and recommendation. Additionally, we investigate the problem of recommending a set of songs to form a playlist as an example of the set recommendation problem. We propose to jointly learn user representations by employing the multi-task learning paradigm, and a key result of equivalence between bipartite ranking and binary classification enables efficient learning of our set recommendation method. Extensive evaluations on real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches for path and set recommendation.","tags":null,"title":"Recommending Structured Objects: Paths and Sets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Minjeong Shin","Dongwoo Kim","Jae Hee Lee","Umanga Bista","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"58aa14934dc883a2ddf762f12a9d0724","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/shin-2019-kgdiff/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.47594Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shin-2019-kgdiff/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose KGdiff, a new interactive visualization tool for social media content focusing on entities and relationships.

Here we analyze the role and influence of socialbots on Twitter by determining how they contribute to retweet diffusions. We collect a large dataset of tweets during the 1st U.S. presidential debate in 2016 and we analyze its 1.5 million users from three perspectives: user influence, political behavior (partisanship and engagement) and botness. First, we define a measure of user influence based on the user's active contributions to information diffusions, i.e. their tweets and retweets. Given that Twitter does not expose the retweet structure -- it associates all retweets with the original tweet -- we model the latent diffusion structure using only tweet time and user features, and we implement a scalable novel approach to estimate influence over all possible unfoldings. Next, we use partisan hashtag analysis to quantify user political polarization and engagement. Finally, we use the BotOrNot API to measure user botness (the likelihood of being a bot). We build a two-dimensional \"polarization map\" that allows for a nuanced analysis of the interplay between botness, partisanship and influence. We find that not only are socialbots more active on Twitter -- starting more retweet cascades and retweeting more -- but they are 2.5 times more influential than humans, and more politically engaged. Moreover, pro-Republican bots are both more influential and more politically engaged than their pro-Democrat counterparts. However we caution against blanket statements that software designed to appear human dominates politics-related activity on Twitter. Firstly, it is known that accounts controlled by teams of humans (e.g. organizational accounts) are often identified as bots. Secondly, we find that many highly influential Twitter users are in fact pro-Democrat and that most pro-Republican users are mid-influential and likely to be human (low botness).","tags":null,"title":"#DebateNight: The Role and Influence of Socialbots on Twitter During the 1st 2016 U.S. Presidential Debate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Toyer","Felipe Trevizan","Sylvie Thiébaux","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6fcf2dcebeab1c9ba5466d6ea452aa7a","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/toyer-2018-action/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.487875Z","relpermalink":"/publication/toyer-2018-action/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we introduce the Action Schema Network (ASNet): a neural network architecture for learning generalised policies for probabilistic planning problems.

They can express more delicate feelings beyond textual information and improve the effectiveness of computer-mediated communication. Recent advances in machine learning make it possible to automatic compose text messages with emojis. However, the usages of emojis can be complicated and subtle so that analyzing and predicting emojis is a challenging problem. In this paper, we first construct a benchmark dataset of emojis with tweets and systematically investigate emoji usages in terms of tweet content, tweet structure and user demographics. Inspired by the investigation results, we further propose a multitask multimodality gated recurrent unit (mmGRU) model to predict the categories and positions of emojis. The model leverages not only multimodality information such as text, image and user demographics, but also the strong correlations between emoji categories and their positions. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy for predicting emojis for tweets (+9.0% in F1-value for category and +4.6% in F1-value for position).

The problem of choice is image caption generation: automatically constructing natural language descriptions of image content. Previous research into image caption generation has focused on generating purely descriptive captions; I focus on generating visually relevant captions with a distinct linguistic style. Captions with style have the potential to ease communication and add a new layer of personalisation. First, I consider naming variations in image captions, and propose a method for predicting context-dependent names that takes into account visual and linguistic information. This method makes use of a large-scale image caption dataset, which I also use to explore naming conventions and report naming conventions for hundreds of animal classes. Next I propose the SentiCap model, which relies on recent advances in artificial neural networks to generate visually relevant image captions with positive or negative sentiment. To balance descriptiveness and sentiment, the SentiCap model dynamically switches between two recurrent neural networks, one tuned for descriptive words and one for sentiment words. As the first published model for generating captions with sentiment, SentiCap has influenced a number of subsequent works. I then investigate the sub-task of modelling styled sentences without images. The specific task chosen is sentence simplification: rewriting news article sentences to make them easier to understand. For this task I design a neural sequence-to-sequence model that can work with limited training data, using novel adaptations for word copying and sharing word embeddings. Finally, I present SemStyle, a system for generating visually relevant image captions in the style of an arbitrary text corpus. A shared term space allows a neural network for vision and content planning to communicate with a network for styled language generation. SemStyle achieves competitive results in human and automatic evaluations of descriptiveness and style. As a whole, this thesis presents two complete systems for styled caption generation that are first of their kind and demonstrate, for the first time, that automatic style transfer for image captions is achievable. Contributions also include novel ideas for object naming and sentence simplification. This thesis opens up inquiries into highly personalised image captions; large scale visually grounded concept naming; and more generally, styled text generation with content control.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic Image Captioning with Style","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siqi Wu","Marian-Andrei Rizoiu","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"8f936d726c4a020bf30d58741c296943","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/wu-2018-beyond/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.484482Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wu-2018-beyond/","section":"publication","summary":"The share of videos in the internet traffic has been growing, therefore understanding how videos capture attention on a global scale is also of growing importance. Most current research focus on modeling the number of views, but we argue that video engagement, or time spent watching is a more appropriate measure for resource allocation problems in attention, networking, and promotion activities. In this paper, we present a first large-scale measurement of video-level aggregate engagement from publicly available data streams, on a collection of 5.3 million YouTube videos published over two months in 2016. We study a set of metrics including time and the average percentage of a video watched. We define a new metric, relative engagement, that is calibrated against video properties and strongly correlate with recognized notions of quality. Moreover, we find that engagement measures of a video are stable over time, thus separating the concerns for modeling engagement and those for popularity -- the latter is known to be unstable over time and driven by external promotions. We also find engagement metrics predictable from a cold-start setup, having most of its variance explained by video context, topics and channel information -- R2=0.77. Our observations imply several prospective uses of engagement metrics -- choosing engaging topics for video production, or promoting engaging videos in recommender systems.","tags":null,"title":"Beyond Views: Measuring and Predicting Engagement in Online Videos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Newman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"6b0b76eed9f23d4c473d0f0760a7c547","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/newman-2018-networks/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.88338Z","relpermalink":"/publication/newman-2018-networks/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Epidemics on networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isobel Routledge","José Eduardo Romero Chevéz","Zulma M.

Considerable progress has been made recently in data-driven predictions, and in linking popularity to external promotions. However, the existing methods typically focus on a single source of external influence, whereas for many types of online content such as YouTube videos or news articles, attention is driven by multiple heterogeneous sources simultaneously - e.g. microblogs or traditional media coverage. Here, we propose RNN-MAS, a recurrent neural network for modeling asynchronous streams. It is a sequence generator that connects multiple streams of different granularity via joint inference. We show RNN-MAS not only to outperform the current state-of-the-art Youtube popularity prediction system by 17%, but also to capture complex dynamics, such as seasonal trends of unseen influence. We define two new metrics: promotion score quantifies the gain in popularity from one unit of promotion for a Youtube video; the loudness level captures the effects of a particular user tweeting about the video. We use the loudness level to compare the effects of a video being promoted by a single highly-followed user (in the top 1% most followed users) against being promoted by a group of mid-followed users. We find that results depend on the type of content being promoted: superusers are more successful in promoting Howto and Gaming videos, whereas the cohort of regular users are more influential for Activism videos. This work provides more accurate and explainable popularity predictions, as well as computational tools for content producers and marketers to allocate resources for promotion campaigns.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Popularity in Asynchronous Social Media Streams with Recurrent Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aditya Krishna Menon","Young Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"cf8ee0fa8a09d7250ca286ade599a5bb","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/menon-2018-proper/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.838187Z","relpermalink":"/publication/menon-2018-proper/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Proper loss functions for nonlinear hawkes processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Mathews","Lexing Xie","Xuming He"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"132d8c8c74ea929c68455e579c0e2c01","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/mathews-2018-semstyle/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.482689Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mathews-2018-semstyle/","section":"publication","summary":"Linguistic style is an essential part of written communication, with the power to affect both clarity and attractiveness.

We develop a model that learns to generate visually relevant styled captions from a large corpus of styled text without aligned images.

One key component is a novel and concise semantic term representation generated using natural language processing techniques and frame semantics.

The former originate from epidemiology, and consider information as a viral contagion which spreads into a population of online users. The latter have roots in geophysics and finance, view individual actions as discrete events in continuous time, and modulate the rate of events according to the self-exciting nature of event sequences. Here, we establish a novel connection between these two frameworks. Namely, the rate of events in an extended Hawkes model is identical to the rate of new infections in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model after marginalizing out recovery events -- which are unobserved in a Hawkes process. This result paves the way to apply tools developed for SIR to Hawkes, and vice versa. It also leads to HawkesN, a generalization of the Hawkes model which accounts for a finite population size. Finally, we derive the distribution of cascade sizes for HawkesN, inspired by methods in stochastic SIR. Such distributions provide nuanced explanations to the general unpredictability of popularity: the distribution for diffusion cascade sizes tends to have two modes, one corresponding to large cascade sizes and another one around zero.","tags":null,"title":"SIR-Hawkes: Linking Epidemic Models and Hawkes Processes to Model Diffusions in Finite Populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marian-Andrei Rizoiu","Swapnil Mishra","Quyu Kong","Mark Carman","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"0ffd555ee1ad7517e53d8fa63b05de70","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/rizoiu-2017-c/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.827833Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rizoiu-2017-c/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"SIR-Hawkes: on the Relationship Between Epidemic Models and Hawkes Point Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Quyu Kong","Marian-Andrei Rizoiu","Siqi Wu","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"c55980864454718cbc40fe4b72fa79c0","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/kong-2018-will/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.487242Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kong-2018-will/","section":"publication","summary":"What makes content go viral? Which videos become popular and why others don't? Such questions have elicited significant attention from both researchers and industry, particularly in the context of online media. A range of models have been recently proposed to explain and predict popularity; however, there is a short supply of practical tools, accessible for regular users, that leverage these theoretical results. Hipie -- an interactive visualization system -- is created to fill this gap, by enabling users to reason about the virality and the popularity of online videos. It retrieves the metadata and the past popularity series of Youtube videos, it employs the Hawkes Intensity Process, a state-of-the-art online popularity model for explaining and predicting video popularity, and it presents videos comparatively in a series of interactive plots. This system will help both content consumers and content producers in a range of data-driven inquiries, such as to comparatively analyze videos and channels, to explain and to predict future popularity, to identify viral videos, and to estimate responses to online promotion.

Recent work analyzing massive datasets advances our understanding of popularity, but one major gap remains: To precisely quantify the relationship between the popularity of an online item and the external promotions it receives. This work supplies the missing link between exogenous inputs from public social media platforms, such as Twitter, and endogenous responses within the content platform, such as YouTube. We develop a novel mathematical model, the Hawkes intensity process, which can explain the complex popularity history of each video according to its type of content, network of diffusion, and sensitivity to promotion. Our model supplies a prototypical description of videos, called an endo-exo map. This map explains popularity as the result of an extrinsic factor -- the amount of promotions from the outside world that the video receives, acting upon two intrinsic factors -- sensitivity to promotion, and inherent virality. We use this model to forecast future popularity given promotions on a large 5-months feed of the most-tweeted videos, and found it to lower the average error by 28.6% from approaches based on popularity history. Finally, we can identify videos that have a high potential to become viral, as well as those for which promotions will have hardly any effect.","tags":null,"title":"Expecting to be HIP: Hawkes Intensity Processes for Social Media Popularity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Liangda Li","Hongbo Deng","Jianhui Chen","Yi Chang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"bd7c240257a43e5182ada0d4a3072607","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/li-2017-learning/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.876269Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-2017-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Learning parametric models for context-aware query auto-completion via hawkes processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miranda Holmes-Cerfon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"7e512ad1e5091a1fabaabc440d91ba5d","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/applied-stat/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.847109Z","relpermalink":"/publication/applied-stat/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Lecture notes in Applied Stochastic Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuan Jin","Mark Carman","Dongwoo Kim","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"acd392f33416d3d782a556f779810b90","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/jin-2017-hcomp/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.488927Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jin-2017-hcomp/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate the possibility of leveraging side information for improving quality control over crowd-sourced data.

This proves a challenge for collaborative filtering algorithms that inherently rely on such information. Recent work has shown that social metadata, such as users' friend groups and page likes, can strongly mitigate the problem. However, such approaches either lack an interpretation as optimising some principled objective, involve iterative non-convex optimisation with limited scalability, or require tuning several hyperparameters. In this paper, we first show how three popular cold-start models are special cases of a linear content-based model, with implicit constraints on the weights. Leveraging this insight, we propose Loco, a new model for cold-start recommendation based on three ingredients: (a) linear regression to learn an optimal weighting of social signals for preferences, (b) a low-rank parametrisation of the weights to overcome the high dimensionality common in social data, and (c) scalable learning of such low-rank weights using randomised SVD. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Loco yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art cold-start recommenders that exploit high-dimensional social network metadata.","tags":null,"title":"Low-rank linear cold-start recommendation from social data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuai Xiao","Junchi Yan","Xiaokang Yang","Hongyuan Zha","Stephen M Chu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"e9c5682566b70c39f177a02b8c6c4630","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/xiao-2017-modeling/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.836305Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xiao-2017-modeling/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modeling the intensity function of point process via recurrent neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["How Jing","Alexander J Smola"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"88d7756684156f4a52486b8fb53bd504","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/jing-2017-neural/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.87817Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jing-2017-neural/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Neural survival recommender","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marian-Andrei Rizoiu","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"98e6aa4e86d400dc0832a133d32d4484","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/rizoiu-2017-online/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.839919Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rizoiu-2017-online/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Online Popularity Under Promotion: Viral Potential, Forecasting, and the Economics of Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marian-Andrei Rizoiu","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"5215b2c901d0f1a4885069b2a7482837","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/rizoiu-2017-promo/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.491957Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rizoiu-2017-promo/","section":"publication","summary":"Modeling the popularity dynamics of an online item is an important open problem in computational social science. This paper presents an in-depth study of popularity dynamics under external promotions, especially in predicting popularity jumps of online videos, and determining effective and efficient schedules to promote online content. The recently-proposed Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP) models popularity as a non-linear interplay between exogenous stimuli and the endogenous reaction. We propose two novel metrics based on HIP: to describe popularity gain per unit of promotion, and to quantify the time it takes for such effects to unfold. We make increasingly accurate forecasts of future popularity by including information about the intrinsic properties of the video, promotions it receives, and the non-linear effects of popularity ranking. We illustrate by simulation the interplay between the unfolding of popularity over time, and the time-sensitive value of resources. Lastly, our model lends a novel explanation of the commonly adopted periodic and constant promotion strategy in advertising, as increasing the perceived viral potential. This study provides quantitative guidelines about setting promotion schedules considering content virality, timing, and economics.","tags":null,"title":"Online Popularity under Promotion: Viral Potential, Forecasting, and the Economics of Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dawei Chen","Dongwoo Kim","Lexing Xie","Minjeong Shin","Aditya Krishna Menon","Cheng Soon Ong","Iman Avazpour","John Grundy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"ec958a2f73e510263e6bd2a654ec9b07","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/chen-2017-recsys/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.490044Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2017-recsys/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an interactive visualisation tool for recommending travel trajectories.

It is strongly desirable for the recommended sequence to avoid loops, as tourists typically would not wish to revisit the same location. Given some learned model that scores sequences, how can we then find the highest-scoring sequence that is loop-free? This paper studies this problem, with three contributions. First, we detail three distinct approaches to the problem -- graph-based heuristics, integer linear programming, and list extensions of the Viterbi algorithm -- and qualitatively summarise their strengths and weaknesses. Second, we explicate how two ostensibly different approaches to the list Viterbi algorithm are in fact fundamentally identical. Third, we conduct experiments on real-world trajectory recommendation datasets to identify the tradeoffs imposed by each of the three approaches. Overall, our results indicate that a greedy graph-based heuristic offer excellent performance and runtime, leading us to recommend its use for removing loops at prediction time.","tags":null,"title":"Revisiting revisits in trajectory recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Zarezade","Abir De","Utkarsh Upadhyay","Hamid R Rabiee","Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"1fa83969ecbc339a1c832e6a83e3f328","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/zarezade/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.846603Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zarezade/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Steering Social Activity: A Stochastic Optimal Control Point Of View.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dawei Chen","Lexing Xie","Aditya Krishna Menon","Cheng Soon Ong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"1861705d4a1a812cc011e65fce343da7","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/chen-2017-structrec/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.489505Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2017-structrec/","section":"publication","summary":"Current recommender systems largely focus on static, unstructured content.

Dubbed Structured Recommendation, this problem differs from the typical structured prediction problem in that there are multiple correct answers for a given input. Motivated by trajectory recommendation, we focus on sequential structures but in contrast to classical Viterbi decoding we require that valid predictions are sequences with no repeated elements. We propose an approach to sequence recommendation based on the structured support vector machine. For prediction, we modify the inference procedure to avoid predicting loops in the sequence. For training, we modify the objective function to account for the existence of multiple ground truths for a given input. We also modify the loss-augmented inference procedure to exclude the known ground truths.

Each of the two main types of recent approaches to the problem, feature-driven and generative models, have desired qualities and clear limitations. This paper bridges the gap between these solutions with a new hybrid approach and a new performance benchmark. We model each social cascade with a marked Hawkes self-exciting point process, and estimate the content virality, memory decay, and user influence. We then learn a predictive layer for popularity prediction using a collection of cascade history. To our surprise, Hawkes process with a predictive overlay outperform recent feature-driven and generative approaches on existing tweet data [44] and a new public benchmark on news tweets. We also found that a basic set of user features and event time summary statistics performs competitively in both classification and regression tasks, and that adding point process information to the feature set further improves predictions. From these observations, we argue that future work on popularity prediction should compare across feature-driven and generative modeling approaches in both classification and regression tasks.","tags":["social media; self-exciting point process; information diffusion; cascade prediction"],"title":"Feature Driven and Point Process Approaches for Popularity Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongteng Xu","Mehrdad Farajtabar","Hongyuan Zha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"2575e44ac5cbf304dcb8510811ecc62b","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/xu-2016-learning/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.836898Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xu-2016-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Learning granger causality for hawkes processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dawei Chen","Cheng Soon Ong","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"3307cde747693a26ae464147796b3446","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/chen-2016/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.494923Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The problem of recommending tours to travellers is an important and broadly studied area. Suggested solutions include various approaches of points-of-interest (POI) recommendation and route planning. We consider the task of recommending a sequence of POIs, that simultaneously uses information about POIs and routes. Our approach unifies the treatment of various sources of information by representing them as features in machine learning algorithms, enabling us to learn from past behaviour. Information about POIs are used to learn a POI ranking model that accounts for the start and end points of tours. Data about previous trajectories are used for learning transition patterns between POIs that enable us to recommend probable routes. In addition, a probabilistic model is proposed to combine the results of POI ranking and the POI to POI transitions. We propose a new F1 score on pairs of POIs that capture the order of visits. Empirical results show that our approach improves on recent methods, and demonstrate that combining points and routes enables better trajectory recommendations.","tags":["Trajectory recommendation; learning to rank; planning"],"title":"Learning Points and Routes to Recommend Trajectories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dongwoo Kim","Lexing Xie","Cheng Soon Ong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"fbf5313e76660eb658b3a5a1013996a7","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/kim-2016/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.494338Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kim-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Knowledge graph construction consists of two tasks: extracting information from external resources (knowledge population) and inferring missing information through a statistical analysis on the extracted information (knowledge completion).

We propose a new probabilistic knowledge graph factorisation method that benefits from the path structure of existing knowledge (e.g. syllogism) and enables a common modelling approach to be used for both incremental population and knowledge completion tasks. More specifically, the probabilistic formulation allows us to develop an incremental population algorithm that trades off exploitation-exploration.

Moreover, we found it was important to properly model power-law phenomena in topic-word distributions and thus we used the full Pitman-Yor process rather than just a Dirichlet process. Furthermore, we propose the transformed Pitman-Yor process (TPYP) to incorporate prior knowledge such as vocabulary variations in different collections into the model. To deal with the non-conjugate issue between model prior and likelihood in the TPYP, we thus propose an efficient sampling algorithm using a data augmentation technique based on the multinomial theorem. Experimental results show the model discovers interesting aspects of different collections.

Recent work on social networks has led to insights about the popularity of a digital item. For example, both the content and the network matters, and gaining early popularity is critical. However, these observations did not paint a full picture of popularity evolution; some open questions include: what kind of popularity trends exist among different types of videos, and will an unpopular video become popular? To this end, we propose a novel phase representation that extends the well-known endogenous growth and exogenous shock model (Crane and Sornette 2008). We further propose efficient algorithms to simultaneously estimate and segment power-law shaped phases from historical popularity data. With the extracted phases, we found that videos go through not one, but multiple stages of popularity increase or decrease over many months. On a dataset containing the 2-year history of over 172,000 YouTube videos, we observe that phases are directly related to content type and popularity change, e.g., nearly 3/4 of the top 5% popular videos have 3 or more phases, more than 60% news videos are dominated by one long power-law decay, and 75% of videos that made a significant jump to become the most popular videos have been in increasing phases. Finally, we leverage this phase representation to predict future viewcount gain and found that using phase information reduces the average prediction error over the state-of-the-art for videos of all phase shapes.","tags":null,"title":"The Lifecyle of a Youtube Video: Phases, Content and Popularity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sharad Goel","Ashton Anderson","Jake Hofman","Duncan J Watts"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"a41f7f5998a236142cc213194ebdbcd8","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/goel-2015/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.847579Z","relpermalink":"/publication/goel-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The structural virality of online diffusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wanying Ding","Yue Shang","Lifan Guo","Xiaohua Hu","Rui Yan","Tingting He"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"ffaa2d6559a23768411bc6506e17110c","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/ding-2015-video/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.85806Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ding-2015-video/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Video popularity prediction by sentiment propagation via implicit network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yong-Jin Liu","Cui-Xia Ma","Qiufang Fu","Xiaolan Fu","Sheng-Feng Qin","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409529600,"objectID":"4691009da3698711680813d171a9f3b8","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/liu-2014-sai-2665935-2645643/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.504897Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-2014-sai-2665935-2645643/","section":"publication","summary":"With the rapid growth of video resources, techniques for efficient organization of video clips are becoming appealing in the multimedia domain. In this article, a sketch-based approach is proposed to intuitively organize video clips by: (1) enhancing their narrations using sketch annotations and (2) structurizing the organization process by gesture-based free-form sketching on touch devices. There are two main contributions of this work. The first is a sketch graph, a novel representation for the narrative structure of video clips to facilitate content organization. The second is a method to perform context-aware sketch recommendation scalable to large video collections, enabling common users to easily organize sketch annotations. A prototype system integrating the proposed approach was evaluated on the basis of five different aspects concerning its performance and usability. Two sketch searching experiments showed that the proposed context-aware sketch recommendation outperforms, in terms of accuracy and scalability, two state-of-the-art sketch searching methods. Moreover, a user study showed that the sketch graph is consistently preferred over traditional representations such as keywords and keyframes. The second user study showed that the proposed approach is applicable in those scenarios where the video annotator and organizer were the same person. The third user study showed that, for video content organization, using sketch graph users took on average 1/3 less time than using a mass-market tool Movie Maker and took on average 1/4 less time than using a state-of-the-art sketch alternative. These results demonstrated that the proposed sketch graph approach is a promising video organization tool.","tags":["Sketching interface","context-aware recommendation","sketch annotation","video organization"],"title":"A Sketch-Based Approach for Interactive Organization of Video Clips","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiyu Wang","Peng Cui","Lexing Xie","Wenwu Zhu","Yong Rui","Shiqiang Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1404172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404172800,"objectID":"debfbcd429d95b42b6e99808f384d90a","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/wang-2014-bcm-2656131-2611388/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.50423Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-2014-bcm-2656131-2611388/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, the amount of multimedia contents in microblogs is growing significantly. More than 20% of microblogs link to a picture or video in certain large systems. The rich semantics in microblogs provides an opportunity to endow images with higher-level semantics beyond object labels. However, this raises new challenges for understanding the association between multimodal multimedia contents in multimedia-rich microblogs. Disobeying the fundamental assumptions of traditional annotation, tagging, and retrieval systems, pictures and words in multimedia-rich microblogs are loosely associated and a correspondence between pictures and words cannot be established. To address the aforementioned challenges, we present the first study analyzing and modeling the associations between multimodal contents in microblog streams, aiming to discover multimodal topics from microblogs by establishing correspondences between pictures and words in microblogs. We first use a data-driven approach to analyze the new characteristics of the words, pictures, and their association types in microblogs. We then propose a novel generative model called the Bilateral Correspondence Latent Dirichlet Allocation (BC-LDA) model. Our BC-LDA model can assign flexible associations between pictures and words and is able to not only allow picture-word co-occurrence with bilateral directions, but also single modal association. This flexible association can best fit the data distribution, so that the model can discover various types of joint topics and generate pictures and words with the topics accordingly.

Specifically, we aim to predict two types of viewcount increases: a sudden increase in viewcount (named as Jump), and the viewcount shortly after the upload of a new video (named as Early). Experiments on hundreds of thousands of videos and millions of tweets show that Twitter-derived features alone can predict whether a video will be in the top 5% for Early popularity with 0.7 Precision@100. Furthermore, our results reveal that while individual influence is indeed important for predicting how Twitter drives YouTube views, it is a diversity of interest from the most active to the least active Twitter users mentioning a video (measured by the variation in their total activity) that is most informative for both Jump and Early prediction. In summary, by going beyond features that quantify individual influence and additionally leveraging collective features of activity variation, we are able to obtain an effective cross-network predictor of Twitter-driven YouTube views.","tags":["popularity prediction","social media","twitter","youtube"],"title":"Twitter-driven YouTube Views: Beyond Individual Influencers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anila Sahar Butt","Armin Haller","Shepherd Liu","Lexing Xie"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"b55565c6afc049d974e6942acb2afe2d","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/butt-2013-activeraul/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.507435Z","relpermalink":"/publication/butt-2013-activeraul/","section":"publication","summary":"With the advent of Linked Data the amount of automatically generated machine-readable data on the Web, often obtained by means of mapping relational data to RDF, has risen significantly.

While topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have a long history of successful application to news articles and academic abstracts, they are often less coherent when applied to microblog content like Twitter. In this paper, we investigate methods to improve topics learned from Twitter content without modifying the basic machinery of LDA; we achieve this through various pooling schemes that aggregate tweets in a data preprocessing step for LDA. We empirically establish that a novel method of tweet pooling by hashtags leads to a vast improvement in a variety of measures for topic coherence across three diverse Twitter datasets in comparison to an unmodified LDA baseline and a variety of pooling schemes. An additional contribution of automatic hashtag labeling further improves on the hashtag pooling results for a subset of metrics.

One fundamental yet unexploited challenge is how to maintain the large indexing structures within a single server subject to its memory constraint, which is extremely hard to scale up to millions or even billions of images. In this paper, we propose to parallelize the near duplicate visual search architecture to index millions of images over multiple servers, including the distribution of both visual vocabulary and the corresponding indexing structure. We optimize the distribution of vocabulary indexing from a machine learning perspective, which provides a “memory light” search paradigm that leverages the computational power across multiple servers to reduce the search latency. Especially, our solution addresses two essential issues: “What to distribute” and “How to distribute”. “What to distribute” is addressed by a “lossy” vocabulary Boosting, which discards both frequent and indiscriminating words prior to distribution. “How to distribute” is addressed by learning an optimal distribution function, which maximizes the uniformity of assigning the words of a given query to multiple servers. We validate the distributed vocabulary indexing scheme in a real world location search system over 10 million landmark images. Comparing to the state-of-the-art alternatives of single-server search (5), (6), (16) and distributed search (23), our scheme has yielded a significant gain of about 200% speedup at comparable precision by distributing only 5% words. We also report excellent robustness even when partial servers crash.","tags":null,"title":"Learning to Distribute Vocabulary Indexing for Scalable Visual Search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ke Zhou","Hongyuan Zha","Le Song"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"7d6034cc1d534ff52b44083d361f37a8","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/zhou-2013-learning/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.833998Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhou-2013-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Learning triggering kernels for multi-dimensional hawkes processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yun Liang","Yong-Jin Liu","Xiao-Nan Luo","Lexing Xie","Xiaolan Fu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"cacc6f776cccff9b77cc970ce579f43d","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/liang-2013-optimal/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.50908Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liang-2013-optimal/","section":"publication","summary":"Image retargeting adjusts images to arbitrary sizes such that they can be viewed on different displays. Content-aware image retargeting has been receiving increased attention. In particular, researchers have improved a patch-wise scaling method for image retargeting at the object level. The scaling partitions the image into rectangular patches of adaptive sizes, which are comparable to the sizes of the salient objects in the image. This partitioning is based on a visual-saliency map; accordingly, the method labels the patches as important or unimportant. Then, the method scales the important patches as uniformly as possible and stretches or squeezes the unimportant patches to fit the target size. A patch-based image-similarity measure finds the optimal set of scaling factors.

The proliferation of tagged social multimedia data presents a challenge to understanding collective tag-use at large scale -- one can ask if patterns from photo tags help understand tag-tag relations, and how it can be leveraged to improve visual search and recognition. We propose a new method to jointly analyze three distinct visual knowledge resources: Flickr, ImageNet/WordNet, and ConceptNet. This allows us to quantify the visual relevance of both tags learn their relationships. We propose a novel network estimation algorithm, Inverse Concept Rank, to infer incomplete tag relationships. We then design an algorithm for image annotation that takes into account both image and tag features. We analyze over 5 million photos with over 20,000 visual tags. The statistics from this collection leads to good results for image tagging, relationship estimation, and generalizing to unseen tags. This is a first step in analyzing picture tags and everyday semantic knowledge.

This article addresses two key issues for mobile search on user-generated videos. The first is the lack of good relevance measurement for learning semantically rich representations, due to the unconstrained nature of online videos. The second is the limited resources on mobile devices, stringent bandwidth, and delay requirement between the device and video server. The authors propose a knowledge-embedded sparse projection learning approach. To alleviate the need for expensive annotation in hash learning, they investigate varying approaches for pseudo label mining, where explicit semantic analysis leverages Wikipedia. In addition, they propose a novel sparse projection method to address the efficiency challenge by learning a discriminative compact representation that drastically reduces transmission costs. With less than 10 percent nonzero elements in the projection matrix, it also reduces computational and storage costs. The experimental results on 100,000 videos show that the proposed algorithm yields performance competitive with the prior state-of-the-art hashing methods, which are not applicable for mobiles and solely rely on costly manual annotations. The average query time for 100,000 videos was only 0.592 seconds.","tags":null,"title":"Scalable Mobile Video Retrieval with Sparse Projection Learning and Pseudo Label Mining","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laijun Zhao","Hongxin Cui","Xiaoyan Qiu","Xiaoli Wang","Jiajia Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"59011e0cb29e986bb4e7d50c39633ff6","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/zhao-2013-sir/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.831773Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhao-2013-sir/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"SIR rumor spreading model in the new media age","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Suvash Sedhain","Scott Sanner","Lexing Xie","Riley Kidd","Khoi-Nguyen Tran","Peter Christen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"e7ea571d068eb99b1b991f77a90272da","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/sedhain-2013-saf-2512938-2512947/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.506336Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sedhain-2013-saf-2512938-2512947/","section":"publication","summary":"Content recommendation in social networks poses the complex problem of learning user preferences from a rich and complex set of interactions (e.g., likes, comments and tags for posts, photos and videos) and activities (e.g., favourites, group memberships, interests). While many social collaborative filtering approaches learn from aggregate statistics over this social information, we show that only a small subset of user interactions and activities are actually useful for social recommendation, hence learning which of these are most informative is of critical importance. To this end, we define a novel social collaborative filtering approach termed social affinity filtering (SAF). On a preference dataset of Facebook users and their interactions with 37,000+ friends collected over a four month period, SAF learns which fine-grained interactions and activities are informative and outperforms state-of-the-art (social) collaborative filtering methods by over 6% in prediction accuracy; SAF also exhibits strong cold-start performance. In addition, we analyse various aspects of fine-grained social features and show (among many insights) that interactions on video content are more informative than other modalities (e.g., photos), the most informative activity groups tend to have small memberships, and features corresponding to “long-tailed” content (e.g., music and books) can be much more predictive than those with fewer choices (e.g., interests and sports). In summary, this work demonstrates the substantial predictive power of fine-grained social features and the novel method of SAF to leverage them for state-of-the-art social recommendation.","tags":["collaborative filtering","recommender systems","social networks"],"title":"Social Affinity Filtering: Recommendation Through Fine-grained Analysis of User Interactions and Activities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez","Jure Leskovec","Bernhard Schölkopf"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"abad394086aa3a0db4c8f11751f86deb","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/gomez-2013-structure/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.880374Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gomez-2013-structure/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Structure and dynamics of information pathways in online media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lexing Xie","Apostol Natsev","Xuming He","John R.

Visual memes are extracted by scalable detection algorithms that we develop, with high accuracy. We further augment visual memes with text, via a statistical model of latent topics.

Experiments are carried out with over 2 million video shots from more than 40,000 videos on two prominent news events in 2009: the election in Iran and the swine flu epidemic. In these two events, a high percentage of videos contain remixed content, and it is apparent that traditional news media and citizen journalists have different roles in disseminating remixed content.

This research area is important for several reasons. First, the presence of near-ubiquitous low-cost computing and communication technologies has enabled people to access and share information at an unprecedented scale. The scale of the data necessitates new research for making sense of such content. Furthermore, popular websites with sophisticated media sharing and notification features allow users to stay in touch with friends and loved ones; these sites also help to form explicit and implicit social groups. These social groups are an important source of information to organize and to manage multimedia data. In this article, we study how media-rich social networks provide additional insight into familiar multimedia research problems, including tagging and video ranking. In particular, we advance the idea that the contextual and social aspects of media are as important for successful multimedia applications as is the media content. We examine the inter-relationship between content and social context through the prism of three key questions. First, how do we extract the context in which social interactions occur? Second, does social interaction provide value to the media object? Finally, how do social media facilitate the repurposing of shared content and engender cultural memes? We present three case studies to examine these questions in detail. In the first case study, we show how to discover structure latent in the social media data, and use the discovered structure to organize Flickr photo streams. In the second case study, we discuss how to determine the interestingness of conversations—and of participants—around videos uploaded to YouTube.

Unlike standard CF algorithms using relatively simple user and item features, recommendation in social networks poses the more complex problem of learning user preferences from a rich and complex set of user profile and interaction information. Many existing social CF methods have extended traditional CF matrix factorization, but have overlooked important aspects germane to the social setting. We propose a unified framework for social CF matrix factorization by introducing novel objective functions for training. Our new objective functions have three key features that address main drawbacks of existing approaches: (a) we fully exploit feature-based user similarity, (b) we permit direct learning of user-to-user information diffusion, and (c) we leverage co-preference (dis)agreement between two users to learn restricted areas of common interest. We evaluate these new social CF objectives, comparing them to each other and to a variety of (social) CF baselines, and analyze user behavior on live user trials in a custom-developed Facebook App involving data collected over five months from over 100 App users and their 37,000+ friends.","tags":null,"title":"New Objective Functions for Social Collaborative Filtering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["George Streftaris","Gavin J Gibson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"5d9f53663eb1d17838100df40b465037","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/streftaris-2012-non/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.851395Z","relpermalink":"/publication/streftaris-2012-non/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Non-exponential tolerance to infection in epidemic systems—modeling, inference, and assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele Merler","Bert Huang","Lexing Xie","Gang Hua","Apostol Natsev"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"db8a1011a0b069299b4b24e2fd953dd1","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/merler-2012-semantic/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.515511Z","relpermalink":"/publication/merler-2012-semantic/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose semantic model vectors, an intermediate level semantic representation, as a basis for modeling and detecting complex events in unconstrained real-world videos, such as those from YouTube.

Our study reveals that the proposed semantic model vectors representation outperforms-and is complementary to-other low-level visual descriptors for video event modeling. We hence present an end-to-end video event detection system, which combines semantic model vectors with other static or dynamic visual descriptors, extracted at the frame, segment, or full clip level. We perform a comprehensive empirical study on the 2010 TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection task (http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/med10.cfm), which validates the semantic model vectors representation not only as the best individual descriptor, outperforming state-of-the-art global and local static features as well as spatio-temporal HOG and HOF descriptors, but also as the most compact. We also study early and late feature fusion across the various approaches, leading to a 15% performance boost and an overall system performance of 0.46 mean average precision.

In particular, a significant challenge is to detect key changes in the social media data, which could reflect important events in the real world, sufficiently quickly. Social media data have three challenging characteristics. First, data sizes are enormous; recent technological advances allow hundreds of millions of users to create and share content within online social networks. Second, social data are often multifaceted (i.e., have many dimensions of potential interest, from the textual content to user metadata). Finally, the data is dynamic; structural changes can occur at multiple time scales and be localized to a subset of users. Consequently, a framework for extracting useful information from social media data needs to scale with data volume, and also with the number and diversity of the facets of the data. In SCENT, we focus on the computational cost of structural change detection in tensor streams. We extend compressed sensing (CS) to tensor data. We show that, through the use of randomized tensor ensembles, SCENT is able to encode the observed tensor streams in the form of compact descriptors. We show that the descriptors allow very fast detection of significant spectral changes in the tensor stream, which also reduce data collection, storage, and processing costs. Experiments over synthetic and real data show that SCENT is faster (17.7x--159x for change detection) and more accurate (above 0.9 F-score) than baseline methods.","tags":null,"title":"SCENT: Scalable Compressed Monitoring of Evolving Multirelational Social Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lexing Xie","Apostol Natsev","John R Kender","Matthew L Hill","John R Smith"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"dff285240b95f601455fa88e78e099fa","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/xie-2011-tracking/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.519531Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xie-2011-tracking/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose tools and methods to track visual memes on community-centric rich-media repositories, such as YouTube.

This paper studies the impact of different attribute and topology based sampling strategies on the discovery of an important social media phenomena–information diffusion. We examine several widely-adopted sampling methods that select nodes based on attribute (random, location, and activity) and topology (forest fire) as well as study the impact of attribute based seed selection on topology based sampling. Then we develop a series of metrics for evaluating the quality of the sample, based on user activity (e.g. volume, number of seeds), topological (e.g. reach, spread) and temporal characteristics (e.g. rate). We additionally correlate the diffusion volume metric with two external variables–search and news trends. Our experiments reveal that for small sample sizes (30%), a sample that incorporates both topology and user context (e.g. location, activity) can improve on naive methods by a significant margin of ~15-20%.","tags":null,"title":"How does The Data Sampling Strategy Impact the Discovery of Information Diffusion in Social Media?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brian Karrer","Mark EJ Newman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"d544a847d851488c271e3fa5baf26b64","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/karrer-2010-message/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.852122Z","relpermalink":"/publication/karrer-2010-message/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Message passing approach for general epidemic models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lexing Xie","Rong Yan","Jelena Tešić","Apostol Natsev","John R Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"626c95602ea5d004f19344b5e9641408","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/xie-2010-probabilistic/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:55:04.521229Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xie-2010-probabilistic/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents probabilistic visual concept trees, a model for large visual semantic taxonomy structures and its use in visual concept detection.

Our analysis shows that none of these models are sufficient in modeling the typical relationships on a real-world visual taxonomy, and these relationships belong to three broad categories -- semantic, appearance and statistics. We propose probabilistic visual concept trees for modeling a taxonomy forest with observation uncertainty. As a Bayesian network with parameter constraints, this model is flexible enough to account for the key assumptions in all three types of taxonomy relations, yet it is robust enough to accommodate expansion or deletion in a taxonomy.

We demonstrate their utility to: cleanse responses to queries contaminated by over-eager YouTube query expansion; separate videos temporally according to their responses to external events; track the evolution and lifespan of continuing video “stories”; automatically locate video summaries already present within a video ecology; quickly verify video copying via a direct application of the Smith Waterman algorithm used in genetics—which also provides useful feedback for tuning the near-dup detection and clustering process; and quickly classify videos via a kind of Lempel-Ziv encoding into the categories of news, monologue, dialogue, and slideshow. We demonstrate a number of novel visualizations of this large dataset, including a direct use of the Matlab black-body “hot” false-color map, together with the GraphViz package, to display the gene-like inheritance of viral properties of keyframes.

The chapter ends with a discussion of two stochastic formulations that cannot be directly related to the SIS and SIR epidemic models. They are discrete time Markov chain formulations applied in the study of epidemics within households (chain binomial models) and in the prediction of the initial spread of an epidemic (branching processes).","tags":null,"title":"An Introduction to Stochastic Epidemic Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fred Brauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"9b6863c5e2a52bad0df15479d0cca415","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/brauer-2008-mathematical/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.845949Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brauer-2008-mathematical/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An Introduction to Stochastic Epidemic Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daryl J Daley","David Vere-Jones"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"655bd6d1c0d6771eabbe549fd727762a","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/daley-2008/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.849703Z","relpermalink":"/publication/daley-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Conditional Intensities and Likelihoods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ping Yan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"efd9e4d939a95031cb3bdaa8ceddbb81","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/yan-2008/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.844926Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yan-2008/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Distribution Theory, Stochastic Processes and Infectious Disease Modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Wächter","L T Biegler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"188030da0765ce22ec1fc162f212f1f7","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/wachter-2006/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.861197Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wachter-2006/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"On the Implementation of a Primal-Dual Interior Point Filter Line Search Algorithm for Large-Scale Nonlinear Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew J Keeling","BT Grenfell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":852076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":852076800,"objectID":"6622392b218ab72e14ba34a8e6334873","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/keeling-1997-disease/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.850436Z","relpermalink":"/publication/keeling-1997-disease/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Disease extinction and community size: modeling the persistence of measles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Don H Johnson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":820454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":820454400,"objectID":"c272e3da384d62b48e0090d7695280c1","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/johnson-1996-point/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.842831Z","relpermalink":"/publication/johnson-1996-point/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Point process models of single-neuron discharges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Fourer","David M Gay","Brian W Kernighan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":536457600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":536457600,"objectID":"31649b1f5fd2e0fdfe8b856da5d5a05e","permalink":"https://behavioral-ds.github.io/publication/fourer-1987-ampl/","publishdate":"2019-12-29T23:50:19.860402Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fourer-1987-ampl/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"AMPL: A mathematical programming language","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.
